## 🚀 Manual Deployment Steps

Since you need to authenticate with Vercel, please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Authenticate with Vercel
```bash
cd /home/sk/projects/CopilotKit/examples/coagents-travel/ui
vercel login
# Choose "Continue with GitHub" and follow the browser authentication
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Production
```bash
vercel --prod --yes
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
3. Add these variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CPK_PUBLIC_API_KEY = your-actual-copilotkit-key
OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-your-actual-openai-key  
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = AIza-your-actual-google-maps-key
NODE_ENV = production
```

### Step 4: Redeploy After Setting Environment Variables
```bash
vercel --prod --yes
```

## 🔧 Alternative Quick Deploy Script

I've created a deployment script for you:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run the deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

This script will:
- Clean install dependencies
- Check environment variables
- Test build locally
- Deploy to Vercel

## 🎯 What's Working Now

- ✅ Next.js 14.2.5 optimized configuration
- ✅ CopilotKit packages properly transpiled
- ✅ PostCSS with autoprefixer configured
- ✅ TypeScript compilation working
- ✅ Tailwind CSS processing
- ✅ React 18 compatibility
- ✅ Environment variable handling
- ✅ Security headers configured
- ✅ Production optimizations enabled

## 🐛 If You Still Get Issues

1. **Build Failures:** Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. **Environment Variables:** Ensure they're set in Vercel, not just locally
3. **API Errors:** Verify your API keys are valid and have proper permissions
4. **CSS Issues:** Clear browser cache and check if styles load

## 🎉 Success Indicators

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter any issues during manual deployment:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
